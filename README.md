# Severson Generalized Cycle Life Prediction

This Showcase enables users to apply the simple linear regression models from Severson et al. Nature Energy (2019) to curated datasets on the Voltaiq Community server, as well as on custom data accessed via a search phrase. Train and test the Severson models, and predict cycle life for ongoing or new tests.
