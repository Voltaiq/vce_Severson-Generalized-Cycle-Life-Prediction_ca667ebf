    "# Cycle Life Prediction: Generalized Severson Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generalizes the analysis presented in Severson's 2019 Nature Energy paper for cycle life prediction from the first 100 cycles of test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of widgets, users can select any number of Train and Test datasets from the Voltaiq Community server, featurize those datasets based on generalizations of the features in Severson et al, train and test the Severson Variance and/or Discharge models on the Train/Test datasets, evaluate model performance, and predict cycle life for any number of Prediction datasets of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs:\n",
    "- **Model(s):** Users can select which models they would like to evaluate. We currently offer comparisons between the Severson Variance, Severson Discharge and Dummy models, but will continue to add in additional models from the literature. We also plan to allow users to specify their own models in the future.\n",
    "    - Once a model is selected, users can Train and Test their models, including showing parity plots, RMSE and MAPE performance plots for their selected model(s).\n",
    "- **Featurization inputs:** The train and test data will be featurized based on the Severson models, with the following nuances:\n",
    "    - Rather than using a hard-coded reference capacity for 80% capacity retention, we allow for a flexible capacity retention threshold based on the initial capacity of a test. Instead of choosing the first cycle to drop below the capacity retention threshold, we choose the first cycle to do so within a sequence of 5 consecutive cycles; this provides some robustness against noise/fluctuations\n",
    "    - A user also inputs the `start` and `end` cycles for which to perform the differencing for the voltage vs capacity data. The default is cycles 9 and 99 to correspond with the Severson analysis (note that Voltaiq uses zero-indexing on cycles as a default, unless they are explicitly specified in an input file). Note that all tests within the Train and Test datasets must include these two cycles.\n",
    "    - A cycle number must also be given from which to calculate reference capacity. The current script implementation allows a user to choose a cycle ordinal from which to calculate a reference capacity. The Severson model used cell nominal capacity as a reference capacity; however this is not known for each dataset on Voltaiq Community. Thus, a reference capacity based on the cycling data is chosen instead. Currently this cycle number must be the same for all datasets used for the model. A fixed reference cycle choice requires a user to have some information about what cycle to choose – the default ordinal is cycle 20 as that works for the curated datasets provided with this script.\n",
    "    - Voltage vs capacity data is still interpolated between the min and max values for each test record; note that the features based on a specific voltage cutoff are no longer applicable\n",
    "- **Train dataset:** Data which will be used to train the ML model(s) you choose. Choose from a number of curated publicly-available datasets, and/or choose custom data based on a test name search criteria\n",
    "    - Tests must include the same `start` and `end` cycle for the analysis range and tests should also obtain the expected end capacity retention %. If tests do not contain the `start` and `end`cycles, the code will throw an error. If tests do not meet the expected capacity retention %, those tests will be excluded from the Train and Test featurization and model evaluation.\n",
    "    - We provide an option for filtering data based on a minimum cycle count, as well as the set capacity retention threshold. Filtering by capacity retention threshold can be slow, so should be used in conjunction with a cycle number and/or test name filter.\n",
    "- **Test dataset:** Data which will be used to test (evaluate the performance) of the ML model(s) you choose. You may either choose to perform a train-test split (with a configurable split ratio) on the Train dataset, or manually choose data in a manner similar to how you chose the Train dataset.\n",
    "- **Prediction dataset:** After a model is trained and evaluated on the test dataset, users can select a Prediction dataset, and use the ML model(s) of their choice to predict the cycle life of this new dataset. Again, users can select from a curated list or choose a custom dataset based on a test name search criteria.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs:\n",
    "- Train/Test parity plots, RMSE, MAPE performance plots\n",
    "- The prediction step will generate a bar chart comparing the predicted cycle life for each model for each test record within the dataset, as well as the current (last) cycle of that test record\n",
    "- All train/test results can be accessed through methods and attributes of the CL_prediction class. Further exploration of the data results is possible using the resulting dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended datasets:\n",
    "The Severson models were developed on fast-charge LFP cycling data. The Variance model contains a single feature based on the variance of the difference between voltage vs capacity curves of two cycles (`start` and `end`). It is likely that these ML models are degradation mode specific. Since the expected degradation mode of the original dataset focused on loss of active material of the negative electrode, cells which have that degradation mode might show better fits. Additionally, it is recommended that similar discharge protocols and cut-off voltages are used for comparison/calculate purposes for the datasets. This is because the features are calculated based on discharge steps, and data is interpolated between the upper and lower cutoff voltages. Significantly different cycling protocols might not allow the ML model to capture the appropriate feature signatures.\n",

    "### Model uncertainty / prediction intervals\n",
    "It is important to not only be able to look at a model's error during the training process, but also be able to estimate or identify the model uncertainty for a new prediction. This can be identified for every new prediction using a model's prediction interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to obtain the prediction intervals. For linear regression, these can be computed analytically. For other models, they are inherently included in the model framework (e.g. Bayesian approaches such as [Bayesian Ridge Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.BayesianRidge.html), [Gaussian Process Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html) and [Gradient Boosting Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.html)). Lastly, there are options for computing the prediction uncertainty using python packages such as [MAPIE](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE), which stands for \"Model Agnostic Prediction Interval Estimator\". A good tutorial on using MAPIE for tabular regression (as is the case for cycle life prediciton) can be found in their [documentation](https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_regression/4-tutorials/plot_main-tutorial-regression.html). The benefits of this approach is that it can be used for any sklearn-compatible regressor, making it a powerful option when trying to compare multiple models!\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAPIE output provides both the prediction value obtained by a model (i.e. the cycle life predicted by a model for a specific input cell), as well as a prediction interval given by a lower and upper bound. This prediction interval provides the bounds for the expected error or noise on the prediction, such that the 'true' value is expected to fall within the prediction interval with `(100-alpha)`% coverage (that is, in `(100-alpha)`% of the cases, we expect the 'true' value to fall within this interval). Note that `alpha` is a tunable parameter but is most commonly taken as `5`, such that we have a 95% prediction interval. Additional documentation on the implementation (in our cse we have chosen the CV+ method) can be found in the [documentation](https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theoretical_description_regression.html), which also references the original publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have augmented this script (after the Frontiers in Energy Research 2022 publication) to include prediction intervals for both the Train/Test data (which can be accessed from the parity plots as well as from dataframes), and for prediction data. Initial inspiration was taken from this [blog post](https://www.valencekjell.com/posts/2022-09-14-prediction-intervals/)"
